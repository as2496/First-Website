      <h5>Dive Deep Into My Life</h5>
      <p>Three things without which I am incomplete are the craving for adventure which can be fulfilled by travelling to places around the world.
           Second is the love for music which is a drug that I am addicted to and last 
          but not the least is my passion for cooking, as food is essential to life and therefore making it good is my choice.</p>
      <div id="travel">
        <p>One of the inevitable desire I have is to pack my bag and set my feet out to explore the world
             whenever time permits and of course when I can afford it. 
            Yet to globetrot, I consider myself lucky enough to be able to explore my own country 
            India- A country with a spectacular mix of people, traditions and landscapes. 
            Memories of my travel is a combination of different smell, sound, 
            food- flavor and visual color that I got to experience which redefines 
            places i visited and brings back the vibes of pleasure felt during the trip long after.<br />
            As rightly quoted –“The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.” 
            My desire is to read the whole book and fill my soul with gratification.

        <p><strong>Quotes that always inspires and elevates my love for music is-<br />
            “Music is the purest form of art... therefore true poets, they who are seers, 
            seek to express the universe in terms of music...The singer has everything within him. 
            The notes come out from his very life. They are not materials gathered from outside.”<br />
            -Rabindranath Tagore</strong><br /><br />
             I take pride in saying that I am a singer even if no one but myself believes in it.
             My musical journey began at the age of 3 and till date it is the only thing that remains close to my heart 
            accompanying me as I travel through phases of my life. It is a soulmate that gives my soul confidence 
            to overcome any hurdle that comes on my way by washing the dust of everyday life.<br /><br />
            <strong>Achievements in my musical journey</strong><br />

        <p>It is a well know phrase among the international students who come abroad to study 
            - “I am doing Master in Computer Science and PHD in COOKING.” <img src="images/AboutPagePics/smily.png" alt="smily" style="width:30px" />
            Yes ‘Cooking’ is a necessity for people like us but for some it becomes a passion.
             Only a year ago tasty food at home was something I relied upon my father to make, the memories of which I do cherish even now. 
            Being away from home, the first thing we all regret is the home made food, but with the inherited gift of culinary skills my repentance is always a little less.
            Oh yes I love to cook! Making new things to treat my taste buds along with those around me has become one of my favorite pastime and sure made me popular in my circle.
